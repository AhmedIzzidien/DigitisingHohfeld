The Racial & Religious Hatred Act 2006 received royal assent 
reinforcing Islamophobia 
There was a vulnerability of Muslims to physical violence and harassment
the consequence of this kind of violence for Muslims was that they were unable to play a full part in mainstream society
Church of England enjoyed protection from the law of blasphemy
some other religious groups in the UK enjoyed protection from the law in other significant areas
The Race Relations Act 1976 (RRA 76) provided protection against discrimination on the grounds of the statutory definition of racial group
mono-ethnic faith communities like the Sikh and Jewish communities were protected from discrimination
they benefited from a positive duty on public authorities to promote equality
protected from aggravated offences of harassment violence and criminal damage motivated by racial hatred
incitement of such hatred
making the fight against racism stronger
many injustices and anomalies would arise as a result
legislation could be used against the very minority communities it was to protect
towards reducing and deterring anti-Muslim violence
their religious buildings and spaces faced a higher risk of crime
this was a distinct and deeper form of harm 
it specifically targeted Muslims because of their membership of a religious group
they also caused additional and distinct harms to the whole Muslim community
the crime was seen as an attack on the whole religious group 
the increasing risks of physical and verbal abuse of Muslims 
commit acts of violence and harassment of Muslims out of deliberate and conscious hatred 
will receive a higher penalty under the criminal law
there was a substantial risk that Muslims would disproportionately become the victims 
it must provide certain safeguards to ensure that the discretion of law enforcement agencies is not abused to target Muslims
this may in turn exacerbate existing tensions between law enforcement agencies and Muslim communities 
minimise the risk of further conflict between them
the exercise of discretion by law enforcement agencies was monitored and accountable
law enforcement agencies should be supervised monitored and held accountable 
the duty on courts to read legislation so far as possible to be compatible with Convention rights
harassment violence and or criminal damage to property resulting from such incitement
Incitement of Racial Hatred
publish insulting or abusive words with the intent to stir up racial hatred 
racial hatred is likely to be stirred up as a result of the action
The definition of racial group is extended by case law 
violence and or criminal damage to property motivated by religious hatred
left to the Courts to define should the occasion arise for such a definition
The Act extends the provisions entailed in the Crime & Disorder Act
which in turn incited others to abuse harass and assault Muslims
the clearest legal duty to consider equality in public procurement was provided by the public sector race equality duty
had in some cases even led to localised disturbances 
UK stood in breach of its obligations under the European Convention of Human Rights
the right to freedom of expression is guaranteed by Article 10
the need to balance incitement with freedom of expression
cases of incitement to religious hatred could be covered under existing common law on incitement 
Attorney Generals fiat could be politically abused
being exploited by the far right to create tensions between communities
members of faith communities have an Article 9 right to be protected from incitement of religious hatred
tackle public disorder and safety issues
the longer these vulnerable communities are exposed to harm and the greater the risk
Government was indeed in breach of its obligations under Article 9 read with Article 14
displays any written material which is threatening abusive or insulting is guilty of an offence
intends thereby to stir up racial or religious hatred
likely to stir up racial or religious hatred
Public Order Act 1986 incorporated the criminal offence of incitement to racial hatred
the social exclusion and isolation of Muslims 
institutional discrimination within law enforcement agencies
the same safeguards and reporting arrangements that apply to the prosecution of cases of racial violence will apply 
offence of incitement to hatred on grounds of religion or belief
The protection is focused more on the religion rather than the individual follower of the religion
the protection they provide uniquely to the Anglican Church
challenged by the Police or the Courts 
interpretation of the terms should be consistent with the approach adopted by the European Court of Human Rights in relation to the Convention
sought to tackle all grounds of unfair discrimination in all spheres of activity
it extended the positive duty requirements of the Race Relations Amendment  Act 2000 beyond race to all the grounds
extra burden on the victim and was a regression from the Directive
governments recognition that unfair discrimination has a damaging effect far beyond any immediate discriminatory practices
basic requirements in law are necessary to curtail such negative and damaging impact on peoples lives
the right to religion is guaranteed under the Human Rights Act
The duty required public bodies to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful racial discrimination
public bodies had to ensure that when they spent public money it was not supporting unlawful discrimination
encouraging and supporting the promotion of race equality
government should promote the incorporation of race equality into public procurement within current legal and policy frameworks
intensification of political violence in the 1960s
the communal violence escalated
only sixteen were later charged with criminal offences
The Prevention of Terrorism
There were also significant attacks in Europe
multiple attacks on the Madrid train network in March 2004
simultaneous explosions on the Underground network and a bus in London killed 52 people
requirements for avoiding risks to health and safety
the Government was forced to respond to the ruling in the Belmarsh cases by repealing legislation on the detention of foreign nationals
was held to be incompatible by the European Court of Human Rights
Commission has been  taking initiatives to combat racism
The departments remained responsible for achieving their PSA targets
To bring about measurable improvements in race equality
to investigate internet-based content which might be illegal under UK law and to take appropriate action
Additionally the government pursued strategic prosecutions
it signalled very clearly that the Muslim right to the provision of education within its religious ethos was to be respected
It not only signalled the right to religious accommodation and meeting of religious needs
Although serious discriminatory practices on the basis of religion were genuine and real there were few safeguards against them
"the curtailment of certain rights through the Anti-Terrorism, Crime & Security Act 2001"
the new commission will prepare the ground for a single Equality Act as one of its first major tasks
The Discrimination Law Review was to consider the opportunities for creating a simpler fairer and more streamlined equality legislation framework in a Single Equality Act
was required to use contract conditions to make sure that the contractor did not discriminate unlawfully
was recruited and managed in ways that are consistent with the public bodys equality duties
the subject of the contract could itself impose equality requirements
the specification for the provision of sexual health counselling services could require the contractor to try to employ both men and women as counsellors to account for cultural sensitivities
how the public body builds race equality into each stage in ways that are compatible with EU rules
Every public body with statutory duties to eliminate discrimination and to promote equality was required to use contract conditions to make sure that the contractor did not discriminate unlawfully
New Labour struck a strategic relationship with the newly formed Muslim Council of Britain 
The key advocates for this legislation have in the main been British Muslim communities 
The leadership took some time learning to do this effectively
first presented by the An-Nisa submission
This was most notably captured by a landmark report 
convened a year earlier by the Runnymede Trust
The report also presented in clear English the evidence it had gathered 
examining the role of the media 
presented in the Runnymede Trust report
subsequently bolstered by a string of other research and publications
the picture was made all the clearer after the 2001 Census question on religion
additional research and Census findings suggested 
The essence of the effort was captured in a leaflet produced by a consortium 
The leaflet argued 
it was enthusiastically campaigned for
it was received with far more caution and deliberation
arguing on occasions that religions should not be ethnicised but allowed to stand on their own
the briefing paper further suggested
highlighted the exercise of discretion concerns 
the briefing further pointed towards concerns 
after considerable discussion in the Muslim communities on the proposal 
Muslims had previously campaigned 
the consortium stressed that it nonetheless had significant reservations about including the extension 
The consortium highlighted evidence indicating existing low levels of satisfaction amongst ethnic minorities 
advised that it would be in the interests of the State
broke away from the rest of the consortium
appeared to be significantly more opposition to this provision 
The proposal was however revived 
courts may give higher penalties 
not to advocate for its extension or abolishment
ready to accept that where that was not possible for practical reasons
the campaign was sustained with full vigour 
several other key Muslim organisations submitted their written evidence
this was subsequently reinforced and augmented by further oral evidence
providing copious references to literature 
religion is based on choice of beliefs values and practices
able to use it as a basis to galvanise a strong alliance of leaders 
strong public statement in support of new legislation 
it was widely claimed that the Bill was an inappropriate vehicle 
gave no indication of any commitment to a timeframe
stating only that it will seek to bring legislation 
demand for this in the face of an upcoming election
The proposal was quickly supported by another alliance 
The proposal was further endorsed on 13 January 2005 
it still attracted significant opposition from various quarters
all of whom were concerned about the limitations 
regarded by himself and some others as the father of equality provisions
The discussions eventually broke down 
with an election promise 
opposition expressed in response to the previous attempts 
resulted in a sustained opposition
two successive votes 
dramatically narrowed the scope 
very significantly watered down from what was intended
concluded with sixty recommendations
drive the changes in public opinion required 
the leaflet cited some graphic examples 
undermined the group and its expert understanding 
it pointed out that there was no principled distinction between race and religion in this instance
a submission from a consortium 
slipped out of sight
evident in how it dealt with the proposals 
the community had not quite given up
its approach was more politically mature
there appeared to be a different tone and approach to the proposed provisions
on this occasion positively advocated the need to support such legislation
religion as choice and therefore needing to be open to criticism
working very closely with the other Muslim organisations
the Bill intended to go beyond the minimum provisions
the Bill sought to set out a single framework
it laid out the details of its main concern
the Bill was thus introduced in Parliament
it was introduced in the House of Lords
the Bill had undermined its key objective
it was important to bear in mind that this Bill had been initiated by the Liberal Democrats
the Government was not supporting the initiative
would allow the Government to discredit the Bill
his would be a useful strategy to show unity with others on the greater cause
win support for an overall framework
filled with specific detail based on particular needs
to place a few strategic amendments
to promote discussions on the other policy concerns
reiterated that the distinction being drawn between philosophical belief and political belief was not helpful
suggesting that it ought perhaps to do so
it welcomed the proposal to harmonise the burden of proof
this Taskforce was to be filled by a Muslim appointed by the Secretary of State for the Department of Trade and Industry
It was to recommend the introduction of new law and procedures to deal with changes to the terrorist threat
many refusing to accept the government’s assessment of the level of the threat from terrorism
On closely examining this literature FAIR concluded
The report did not make any specific recommendations
Separate from this case made on the basis of the overlap between race and religion
BMRC urged that the Bill treated all the strands of discrimination including religion consistently
Muslims were also concerned
In a strongly worded letter from the Secretary General
This was further reinforced through a meeting and exchanges
acknowledging the strong response from the MCB and its persuasiveness
if they chose to enter into contracts with a public body
The Muslim Council of Britain was invited to provide a representative
it feels very much that it is finding reasons to justify the status quo
a cross departmental approach to capacity building in the departments and the communities
